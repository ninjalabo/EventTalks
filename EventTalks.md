### 🧭 Overview & Problem Statement

* Large-scale events in Espoo often lead to **traffic congestion** and **parking difficulties**, resulting in higher CO₂ emissions.
* EventTalks uses **AI-powered cameras and a conversational UI** to provide **real-time, personalized routing and parking guidance**.
* The solution contributes directly to Espoo’s **2030 carbon neutrality goal** by reducing idling, search traffic, and emissions.

### 🎯 Pilot Objectives

* Optimize event-time traffic and parking via **real-time, automated API mashups** (e.g., parking availability, bike stations, routing).
* Enhance visitor experience with **push-style guidance** delivered through a conversational interface.
* Require **no additional infrastructure** beyond overhead cameras for parking—users interact via their own smartphones.

### 🛠 Technical Components

* **LLMCAM**: Language + Vision Fusion
* **MCP**: Mobility Control Platform (aggregates camera, routing, parking data)
* **GenUI**: Generative conversational UI framework
